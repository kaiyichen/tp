LinkedOUT is the only application that any experienced recruiter needs. LinkedOUT allows recruiters to keep track of many applicants, and the job they applied for. You can store their contact details, skills and the round of their application, all in one place.

LinkedOUT helps recruiters manage the multiple job applications they may receive on a daily basis. With many applications, it may be difficult to keep track of each applicant and which application round they are currently at.

Thus, LinkedOUT aims to improve a recruiter's experience. LinkedOUT presents recruiters with the ability to flag important applicants, edit applicants easily and search for them with ease.

LinkedOUT comes with a Command Line Interface (*CLI*) as well as a Graphical User Interface (*GUI*) in order to provide recruiters a more streamlined experience.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its *API* in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---
### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicantListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible *GUI*.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/linkedout-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/linkedout-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Applicant` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `LinkedoutParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an applicant).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` *API* call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `LinkedoutParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `LinkedoutParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---
### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the LinkedOUT application data i.e., all `Applicant` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicantList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Applicant` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Applicant>`. This _filtered_ list is then wrapped around a `SortedList` to create a _filtered_, _sorted_ list that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes or is sorted.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---
### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/linkedout/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both LinkedOUT application data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `LinkedoutStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---
### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.linkedout.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add applicant feature

#### Rationale

The add command allows the user to add a new applicant to the LinkedOUT list.

#### Implementation

The add command is facilitated by creating an `AddCommand`. `AddCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute()` method.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the add operation:

![AddCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** There should only be one arrowhead at the end of every line
in the Activity Diagram. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario of how an applicant is added, and how the operation is handled by LinkedOUT:

1. The user enters a valid add command, for example: `add n/Bob p/99991111 e/bob@mail.com j/Data Analyst r/Interview s/Python`. For each command
`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked, which calls `LinkedoutParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `add` and the argument
`n/Bob p/99991111 e/bob@mail.com j/Data Analyst r/Interview s/Python`


2. Upon identifying the add command, `AddCommandParser` is instantiated and uses `AddCommandParser#parse()` to
map the various prefixes to the attributes: (e.g `n/` to `Bob`, `p/` to `99991111`)


3. `AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()` is called to ensure all the mandatory prefixes have been inputted by the user. After which
`AddCommandParser#parse()` creates the new `Applicant`


4. `AddCommandParser#parse()` then initializes an `AddCommand` with the new `Applicant` as an argument. `AddCommand#execute()`
is then called, which calls `Model#hasApplicant()` to ensure that the new `Applicant` is not a duplicate of any existing applicant in the
LinkedOUT. upon completion of the check, `Model#addApplicant()` to add the new applicant in LinkedOUT.


5. The command is complete and a `CommandResult` containing the details of the new applicant as a String is returned to
the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How add executes:**

* **Alternative 1 :** Check whether specified applicant already exists before creating an Applicant object.
    * Pros: Avoid creation of unnecessary objects
    * Cons: May cause reduced performance

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---

### Add Skill feature

#### Rationale

The addskill command allows users to add skills to a specific applicant. This command was designed to accommodate edit's functionality when editing skills. To remove skills from an applicant, one can choose to use edit instead.

The reasoning for only including an addskill functionality is that most applicants would pick up new skills, but not lose knowledge of pre-existing ones.

#### Implementation

The addskill mechanism is facililated by `AddSkillCommandParser`. 
`AddSkillCommandParser` parses the inputs using `AddSkillCommandParser#parseSkillsForEdit()` and returns a new set of skills to `AddSkillCommand`.

`AddSkillCommand` then searches for the applicant within the applicant list, and appends the skills to the pre-existing set.

As the skills being passed are checked in `AddSkillCommandParser` and `Skill` upon instantiation, skills parsed can contain a mix of symbols and alphanumeric. They must also be made up of 1 to 5 words.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the addskill operation:

![AddSkillActivityDiagram](images/AddSkillCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how an applicant is edited.

1. The user enters the addskill command with the specific index and skills to add, `addskill 1 s/C++ s/Vue`.


2. `LinkedoutParser` is invoked to handle the command `addskill` through `LinkedoutParser#parseCommand()`.


3. It then calls upon `AddSkillCommandParser#parse()` to check if the input is empty.


4. If input is not empty, it passes the input to `AddSkillCommandParser#parseSkillsForEdit()` to create a new set, representing the skills to be added.


5. The result is then used to instantiate `AddSkillCommand`. `AddSkillCommand` then finds the applicant at the specified index.


6. With `AddSkillCommand#createEditedApplicant()`, the applicant's pre-existing skills are appended with the new set, and the applicant is added to the model.


7. It then calls upon `CommandResult` to display the final result on the *GUI*.

![AddSkillSequenceDiagram](images/AddSkillCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How addskill executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new applicant replace old information.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Change edit command functionality to allow it to add, delete, clear and replace skills.
    * Pros: One lesser command needed.
    * Cons: Adds extra complexity in code as well as for the user.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

---

### Edit applicant feature

#### Rationale

The edit command allows users to change the applicant's details.

#### Implementation

The proposed edit mechanism is facilitated by `EditApplicantDescriptor`. `EditApplicantDescriptor` stores the details of the applicant to change.

The user need to specify an `Index` to select the applicant to edit. `editCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute()` method.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the edit operation:

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how an applicant is edited.

1. The user enters the edit command with the specific fields to edit, `edit 1 n/Alex Tan`.


2. LinkedOUT updates the applicant with the edited information.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How edit executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new applicant replace old information.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Replace individual fields inside original applicant.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (Do not have to create an extra applicant).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command to change an information is correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

### View applicant feature

#### Rationale

The view command searches a **single** applicant in LinkedOUT and returns the applicant's details.
It is used when users wish to find a specific applicant they have in mind.
It takes in a single case-insensitive parameter, which is the applicant's full name. No prefix is required.

#### Implementation

The view command is facilitated by `NameContainsAllKeywordsPredicate` which helps the parser match the input.

The user needs to specify a `Name` to allow the application to match and select the applicant. `ViewCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute()` method.

As `ViewCommandParser` uses `NameContainsAllKeywordsPredicate`, the `Name` being passed will not match if it contains additional whitespace, but will match inputs which are case-insensitive.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the view operation:

![ViewActivityDiagram](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how to view a specific applicant.

1. The user enters the view command with the specific name, `view Alex Tan`.


2. `LinkedoutParser` is invoked to handle the command `view` through `LinkedoutParser#parseCommand()`.


3. It then calls upon `ViewCommandParser#parse()` to check if the input is empty.


4. If input is not empty, it passes the input to `NameContainsAllKeywordsPredicate()`.


5. The result is then initialized as a predicate in `ViewCommand`. `ViewCommand#execute()` then tries to find a match.


6. It then calls upon `CommandResult` to display the final result on the *GUI*.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works:

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How view executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Shows a single applicant.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Result is specific.
    * Cons: Strict matching.
    * Cons: Have to remember applicant's name and type it fully.

* **Alternative 2:** Shows multiple applicants based on partial matches.
    * Pros: Less strict matching.
    * Cons: Users are unable to single out a certain applicant.

Weighing the pros and cons of these alternatives, we have decided to abstract alternative 2 as a different feature under `search`.
This is to allow our target user to have greater flexibility, and we believe both are important features to be implemented.

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

---
### Search applicant feature

#### Rationale

The search command searches for applicant(s) in LinkedOUT and returns the applicant(s)' details.
It is used when users wish to search for applicant(s) they have in mind.
It takes in prefix(es) with case-insensitive parameter, which can be applicant's name, job, round and skill.

#### Implementation

The proposed search mechanism is facilitated by `SearchCommandParser`. `SearchCommandParser` will map the creation of `KeywordsPredicate` based on the input prefix. `KeywordsPredicate` supports the following implementation:
* `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` — Predicate which returns true if an applicant's full name matches partially with the exact input attribute.
* `JobContainsKeywordsPredicate` — Predicate which returns true if an applicant's job name matches partially with the exact input attribute.
* `RoundContainsKeywordsPredicate` — Predicate which returns true if an applicant's round matches partially with the exact input attribute.
* `ApplicantContainsSkillKeywordsPredicate` — Predicate which returns true if an applicant's skill matches partially with the exact input attribute.

These predicates assist the filtering of applicant list in the `Model` interface, specifically for  `Model#updateSearchApplicantList()` and `Model#getDefaultApplicantList()`.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow of the search command:

![SearchActivityDiagram](images/SearchCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Example 1
1. The user enters search command with prefix and specified attribute, `search n/David Lee`.


2. The input attributes will be passed into `SearchCommandParser` and creates a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` if the attribute
   and prefix are not empty.


3. The predicate is then passed into `Model#updateSearchApplicantList()` to filter and display applicants with partial name
   matching of `David` or `Lee` in LinkedOUT.


Example 2
1. The user enters `search j/Software n/David` command to search for applicants in LinkedOUT.


2. The input attributes will be passed into `SearchCommandParser` and creates a `JobContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` if the attributes are not empty.


3. The predicate is then passed into `Model#updateSearchApplicantList()` to filter and sort the applicants with partial job and name matching of `Software` or `David`. Applicant with the most matched attributes will be displayed on the top of LinkedOUT.

The following sequence diagram shows how the search operation works:

![SearchSequenceDiagram](images/SearchSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How search executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses prefixes to search for applicants with combination of matching attributes.
    * Pros: Able to search an applicant using combination of different fields/prefixes. Provides a more precise and broader search.
    * Cons: Hard to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Only search for an applicant using partial matching name.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Inflexible use of search command.

### Sort applicant feature

#### Rationale

The sort command shows the list of applicants **temporarily** sorted by either `NAME` or `JOB` and in ascending or descending order.

#### Implementation

The proposed sort mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommandParser`. 
`SortCommandParser` will map the creation of `SortComparator` based on the input prefix and returns a `SortCommand` with
the `SortComparator`.

`SortCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute()` method.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user enters the sort command with the specific field to sort by and sorting order,
   `sort f/name o/asc`.
   
2. The input fields will be passed into `SortCommandParser` and creates a `SortComparator` 
   if the field and order are not empty.
   
3. The `SortComparator` is then passed into `Model#updateDefaultApplicantList()` to sort and display
   the list of sorted applicants in LinkedOUT.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How sort executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays a temporary sorted list
    * Pros: Original order of list retained.
    * Cons: Unable to sort list permanently.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort list permanently.
    * Pros: List can be permanently sorted.
    * Cons: Original order in list is lost.

### Flag applicant feature

#### Rationale

The flag feature and it's associated `flag` command allows the user to flag an existing applicant in the LinkedOUT list, pinning them to the top for easy reference.

#### Implementation
The flag mechanism is facilitated by the `FlagCommandParser`. `FlagCommandParser` parses the user inputs using `FlagCommandParser#parse()` to obtain the index of the applicant to be flagged.

`FlagCommand` then searches for the applicant in the applicant list, and toggles it's flagged status.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the flag operation:

![FlagCommandActivityDiagram](images/FlagCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how an applicant is flagged, and how the operation is handled by LinkedOUT:

1. The user enters a valid flag command, for example: `flag 1`. For each command `LogicManager#execute()` is invoked, which calls `LinkedoutParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `flag` and the argument `1`.

2. Upon identifying the flag command, `FlagCommandParser` is instantiated and uses `FlagCommandParser#parse()` to obtain the index of the applicant to be flagged.

3. `ParserUtil#parseIndex(args)` is then called by `FlagCommandParser#parse()` to obtain the index of the applicant to be flagged as an argument to be passed around internal components, as well as to check the validity of the index provided.   

4. `FlagCommandParser#parse()` then initializes a `FlagCommand` with the obtained index as the argument.
   
5. The logic manager calls `FlagCommand#execute()` which obtains the applicant at the specified index.
    
6. With `FlagCommand#createFlaggedApplicant()`, the applicant obtained is cloned, but it's flagged status is toggled, and the initial applicant obtained is replaced by its cloned version.

7. A call to `CommandResult` then displays the final result on the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the flag operation works:

![FlagSequenceDiagram](images/FlagSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

Aspect: How flag executes :
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Create a new applicant with toggled flag status to replace the specified applicant.
  * Pros: Immutability, easier to debug, and less side effects.
  * Cons: More memory usage, more verbose to implement.
* Alternative 2: Change the state of the applicant directly, by making the flag status mutable.
  * Pros: Less verbose to implement.
  * Cons: Change of applicant state makes debugging the application harder, and contains possibility of introducing side effects.

[Back to top <img src="images/back-to-top-icon.png" width="25px" />](#table-of-contents)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedLinkedout`. It extends `Linkedout` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `linkedoutStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedLinkedout#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedLinkedout#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedLinkedout#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitLinkedout()`, `Model#undoLinkedout()` and `Model#redoLinkedout()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedLinkedout` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th applicant in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitLinkedout()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `linkedoutStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new applicant. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitLinkedout()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `linkedoutStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitLinkedout()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `linkedoutStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the applicant was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoLinkedout()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Linkedout state, then there are no previous Linkedout states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoLinkedout()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoLinkedout()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `linkedoutStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone Linkedout states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoLinkedout()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitLinkedout()`, `Model#undoLinkedout()` or `Model#redoLinkedout()`. Thus, the `linkedoutStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitLinkedout()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `linkedoutStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the applicant being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Technical: The application should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Performance: The application should be able to hold up to 1000 applicants without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  Performance: The system should take at most 2 seconds to return an output.
4.  Disaster Recovery: In case of system failure, the application should still contain data saved up to the last command executed.
5.  Persistency: The system should save after a command to ensure no data loss.
6.  Testing: There should be at least one test case for each major component.
7.  Fault Tolerance: The system should not crash due to an invalid input but instead show an error message.
8.  Portability: The application should run on an imported _JSON_ file as long as it adheres to the format used when saving to files.
9.  Efficiency: A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
10. Usability: The user interface should be clean and intuitive for users who have basic IT knowledge.
11. Process: The project is expected to adhere to a schedule based off our milestones from the different versions ranging from v1.1 to v1.4.
12. Documentation: User Guide should be able to be understood by readers who have basic IT knowledge.

    3. Test case: `search n/Bob`<br>
       Expected: Only applicant named `Bob Tan` is displayed in the list.

    4. Test case: `search n/bOb`<br>
       Expected: Only applicant named `Bob Tan` is displayed in the list. This is because search attributes are case-insensitive.

    5. Test case: `search n/Jason`<br>
       Expected: No applicant is displayed in the list.

    6. Test case: `search n/Bo`<br>
       Expected: No applicant is displayed in the list. This is because search attribute has to be an exact word (can be split by spacing).

    7. Test case: `search j/Bob`<br>
       Expected: No applicant is displayed in the list. This is because the search attribute has to match with the correct prefix.

    8. Test case: `search n/Tan j/Engineer`<br>
       Expected: Both applicants are displayed in the list but `Bob Tan` is shown on the top of the list. This is because applicant with the most matching attributes will be displayed first.

    9. Test case: `search n/Amy j/Engineer`<br>
       Expected: Both applicants are displayed in the list and the order of applicant shown is based on the original list. In this case, `Bob Tan` is shown above `Amy Tan`.

    10. Other incorrect search commands to try: `search`, `Search`, `search Bob`, `search w/Bob`, `search n/`<br>
        Expected: No applicant is displayed. Error details shown in the status message.
